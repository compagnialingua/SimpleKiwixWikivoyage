<section id="what-does-kiwix-do">
	<h2>What does Kiwix do?</h2>
	<p><em>Kiwix</em> is an offline content reader. It acts very much like a browser but instead of accessing <em>online web pages</em>, it reads content from a file in <em>ZIM format</em>.</p>
	<p>While Kiwix has been originaly designed to provide Wikipedia offline, it also reads other contents.</p>
</section>

<section id="where-do-i-find-content">
	<h2>Where is the content?</h2>
	<p>The contents are located on the <a href="http://kiwix.org/m/">kiwix website</a>.</p>
	<p>They are available as ZIM files. There are <strong>a lot</strong> of them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wikipedia is available separately for each language</li>
		<li>Other contents like Wikileaks or Wikisource are also available</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Carefuly select the one(s) you want and launch the download. Put the resulting files on your SD card then open them with Kiwix.</p>
	<p>Depending on the content and your Internet connection on this device, it might be preferable to download from a Desktop computer and transfer to your SD card.</p>
</section>

<section id="can-wikipedia">
	<h2>Can I download from Wikipedia directly?</h2>
	<p>Yes! You can create a <em>book</em> while browsing Wikipedia and add as many article to this <em>book</em>. Once done, you can download the book as an <em>OpenZIM file</em>. This file can be opened by Kiwix.</p>
	<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Book">Book Creator</a> documentation on Wikipedia for more infos.</p>

<section id="large-zim">
	<h2>How to use large ZIM files?</h2>
	<p>If your ZIM file weights more than 4GB, you might not be able to store it on your SD card due to filesystem limitations.</p>
	<p>In this case, please split it using one of the following software:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> On Microsoft Windows: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~hoangle/filesj/">FSJ-Lite</a></li>
		<li> On Apple Mac OSX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://loekjehe.home.xs4all.nl/Split&amp;Concat/">Split&amp;Concat</a></li>
		<li> On GNU/Linux and with the console: <code>split --bytes=4000M my_big_file.zim</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> your resulting files must be named <code>my_big_file.zimaa</code>, <code>my_big_file.zimab</code>, etc.</p>
